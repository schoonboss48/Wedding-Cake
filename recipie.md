Preheat your oven to 335ยบF and prepare two 8"x2" cake pans with cake goop or another preferred pan release.
Place butter in a stand mixer with a paddle attachment and cream until smooth. Sprinkle in your sugar and then let whip on high until light and white (about 5 minutes)
Combine your flour, baking powder and salt and set aside
Combine milk, oil and extracts and set aside
Add in egg whites one at a time (roughly) and let fully combine after each addition before adding the next. If your egg whites aren't at room temperature you can microwave them for a few seconds. Be careful not to cook them! Cold egg whites will curdle the batter. 
Add in 1/3 of your dry ingredients and let combine. Add in 1/2 of your liquids, then dry, then liquids and the rest of your dry. Let mix until just combined. 
Add batter into prepared cake pans and bake at 335ยบ F for 25-35 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean when poked in the center. 
Let cool ten minutes then turn out cakes onto a cooling rack. Wrap warm and place into the freezer to flash chill. This locks in the moisture. Once cool but not frozen you can then trim off the brown edges of your cakes and frost as desired. Chill cake.
